## Overview

This app aims to utilize the full stack to collect user inputs, compare them to database records, and return data back to the DOM. It works as a personality survey that compiles a new users Name, picture, and answers that are measured against other 'friend' records to find the best matching profile. Using Express.js, the best friend match data is sent back to render as modal content on the page.
